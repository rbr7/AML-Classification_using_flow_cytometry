# AML-Classification_using_flow_cytometry

### Project
- The goal of this project is to predict patient’s AML or normal status from patient blood samples profiled by flow cytometry.

Flow cytometry

Flow: what is it?
- Evaluate cells in single-cell suspension
- Sample is prepared in liquid form 
- Cells flow in a thin stream (usually saline)
- Cells pass a detector one by one.

Cytometry: what does the detector measure?
- How much of something exists inside or on the surface of a cell?
- Surface protein markers: CD19/20, CD3/4/8, …
- Proteins markers inside: pStat3/5, pAKT, …
- Size, granularity, DNA content, viability …

### Data
